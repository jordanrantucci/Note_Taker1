# Note_Taker1

## Description 

This is a CWRU coding bootcamp homework assignment practicing Node.js and express.  The project tests the students ability to incorporate the NPM express into their code.  The project practices the ability to get, post, and delete documents to a JSON and be able to store them and delete them.  The poject also incorporates the ability to deploy an app onto heroku.

AS A USER I would like a simple application that I can take notes digitally with.  I would like the notes to be saved onto the server and have the ability to be recalled and deleted.
